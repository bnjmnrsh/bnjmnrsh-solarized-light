# BnjmnRsh Solarized-Light

A dark take on Solarized-Light, heavily informed by Wes Bos' Colbalt2 theme

## What's in the folder

* `package.json` - this is the manifest file that defines the location of the theme file and specifies the base theme of the theme.
* `themes/Bnjmnrsh Solarized Light-color-theme.json` - the color theme definition file.

## Get up and running

To live edit the theme

* Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
* Open `File > Preferences > Color Themes` and pick your color theme.
* Open a file that has a language associated. The languages' configured grammar will tokenize the text and assign 'scopes' to the tokens. To examine these scopes, invoke the `Developer: Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes` command from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac).

## Make changes

* Changes to the theme file are automatically applied to the Extension Development Host window.

## Install your extension

* To start using your extension with Visual Studio Code copy it into the `<user home>/.vscode/extensions` folder and restart Code.
* To share your extension with the world, read on <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs> about publishing an extension.
